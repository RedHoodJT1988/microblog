This is a simple example of a Flask application that handles everything
one would need to while creating a Flask app. Currently it uses the Jinja2
templating system but that can be removed in favor of a frontend framework
such as React, Angular or Vue. The features of the app are as follows:

1. User Registration
2. User Profiles
3. User Login
4. Forms
5. Database Migrations and Creation
6. Blog posts

I am sure that I left out some features but I will update this README with 
all the features as I add them these are the basic features per my initial
design document that I can remember.
